NGC 2244 is an open cluster in the Rosette Nebula, however this image of it is processed as a nebulae image in my opinion. I love the details in the dust clouds around the core of the nebula, and how the hydrogen lights up everything with a red glow revealing details in the formations around the star cluster. Rosette is likely one of the most pretty nebulas to photograph, there are a lot of good areas to zoom on and produce different colors and perspectives.

I was more interested in learning how to gather light when I started out with astrophotography, then when my processing and light gathering skills improved I started framing things so there was a direction and intended outcome. That said, my first attempt at the Rosette was less than exciting.

I found that my 61mm Williams Optics ZenithStar doublet refractor I have is better suited to the Rosette Nebula, you can frame the entire thing. If I'm interested in more close-up views of the nebula's features then I'll go in with the ED-102. But I really enjoy this one because you can shoot it with a very wide angle lens. I'd like to try it with the D850 Nikon camera sometime.

This is by far my favorite picture of the Rosette. I liked the processing and framing, its one I'm proud of and will stand out in the [gallery](/gallery).  
  
This next one was another attempt using the ED102 Explore Scientific Triplet Refractor. I wanted to explore the color difference when using a Triplet Refractor, so I thought I'd give it another shot.  I was not as impressed with the results but I think I achieved my goal of bringing in more detail of the dust clouds floating around the donut of the Nebula.

I'd love to get some closer-in images of the star cluster in the center, perhaps a barlow on a really steady night might get me closer in, and my new guide camera might help for more consistent guiding.
