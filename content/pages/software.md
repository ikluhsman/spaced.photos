I'll review different software tools that are available that are specific to astrophotography, and contrast those tools with typical image processing programs such as Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom, Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), and Serif's Affinity Photo 2.

I'll go right ahead and say that PixInsight is by far THE best tool for processing astrophotography raw imagery, but the learning curve is steep for this program. Using an advanced tool like this might change your thinking in how you shoot your images in the first place.

Using other tools like Photoshop exclusively to process pictures of the stars will not yield as good of a result as a properly processed image in PixInsight, but you can still get pretty darn close if you have a little bit of advanced knowledge of digital image processsing.

In any case, several softwares will need to be explored to demonstrate the trial and error that I went through to arrive at the conclusion that I needed to use PixInsight exclusively and then polish the final image with another good image tool such as Photoshop or Affinity Photo.

In any case, appreciate the following ~
