## Image Processing Using Computers

If you are completely new to astrophotography or just observing the sky in general, computer software can make the experience of observing much more enjoyable, but it is also what makes modern deep-sky astrophotography what it is today. Just about everything can typically be controlled and automated from a computer using simple electronics controls. There are very simple ways of photographing the sky without a computer, such as using a manual mount, and "nudging" the mount to reframe images and take pictures. However, using computers we can now hold the telescope still indefinitely, and use the computer to control the camera exposure. This results in the ability to take much, much, *longer* exposures to gather more light in each image from the dark sky.  
  
I tend to think of astrophotography software in categories, depending on their function. Each piece of software has a purpose and unique ability. In my head, here is how I tend to categorize the software I've explored:

- Planetarium Software
- Image Processing
- Specialized Tools

## Planetarium Software
  
Planetarium software is just software that helps you explore the stars with your computerized telescope hardware. A lot of times when you buy a computerized telescope, it comes with software to control the telescope from your computer or mobile device. It usually includes a 3d representation of the sky, and the ability to aim the telescope automatically at a particular object that you want to observe. Here are a few popular planetarium software titles:

- SkyMap
- Stellarium
- KStars
- Cartes du Ciel / SkyChart
- Celestia
  
## Image Processing
  
Image processing is the second half of producing an image after capturing the raw image data with your camera and telescope. Most people think of this in terms of processing a raw DSLR photo in a program like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to create the look they want for the image. Processing an image of the night sky or deep space is quite different, however. We are not really trying to just enhance a photo, but develop the photo from blending lots of different raw images together. Think of a raw image as a negative filmstrip in an old 35mm film camera. You can take the negative or raw image, and develop it into a usable photograph. How you develop the picture determines the look the image will have for the final result.  
  
Generally, there is no main-stream market for astrophotography software. Sure there are image processing programs such as Adobe Photoshop, or Serif Affinity Photo, which are great for finishing off and developing your astro photos, or processing DSLR photography. However, these programs lack the workflow and tooling to adequately process an astrophotography picture the "proper" way.

## PixInsight

[PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com) stands proud from all other image processing software, and deserve to be singled out as one of the most advanced, if not *the* most advanced tool to process photographs of space. It is not free, but PixInsight contains a collection of tools and processes that have been scientifically designed to process images of deep space.
  
There are other programs that will do similar things, like image calibration, stacking, etc, and you can still get good results with these programs. Generally speaking, you'll develop some kind of workflow with software that works for you. An example might be stacking your calibration frames in DeepSkyStacker, then taking your stacked image and finishing it off in Adobe Photoshop. I prefer following [PixInsight tutorials](https://pixinsight.com/tutorials/) because it pretty much does it all without jumping between programs.  

## Conclusion

If you want a single piece of software that's your one-stop-shop for processing deep space images, you want to process images with the right tools, and possess some advanced knowledge of regular image processing, then PixInsight is hands-down the best choice for processing your astrophotography image data.

If you're more of a beginner computer imaging creator, then try out some of the tools like DeepSkyStacker that help you along in your workflow, then finish off the photo in a program you're familiar with such as Adobe Photoshop.
