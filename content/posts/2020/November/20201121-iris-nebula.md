I was really excited when I learned what the term "circumpolar" means. It means that an object you are viewing in the sky will never disappear behind the horizon, because it is close enough to the polar axis of Earth and is therefore visible to you all night in relation to your latitude. That means for the Iris Nebula that I had ALL NIGHT to photograph it!

## My Thoughts

I was pretty excited to see what longer integration times do to help processing the photo. I was pleased with the result, I especially like the dark looking brown ominus clouds surrounding this Nebula, it looks like a wicked thunderstorm out in space. You can see how the dark clouds block out stars all the way around the nebula.
