Now the more portable gear sacrifices capabilities for a lighter setup. My absolute favorite way to go is just a regular DLSR half-frame camera on a star-tracker, and using my normal DSLR camera tripod.

I have a small ZWO guide scope and camera that I carry with it. So if I have more time my bigger DSLR lenses with me, I can actually track something.

Of course you'll probably need a computer as well unless you have some gear that interfaces on your mobile devices. I find the more advanced software on a laptop more appealing, but there is something to be said about the convenience of a mobile phone or tablet controlling the scope. I just find I have more granular control when using more advanced software such as KStars/EKOS. See my [software page](/software) for more info on planetarium software, guiding software, and image processing software.
