![w-full Monkey's Head Nebula](/catalogue/20201223-MonkeyHeadNebula.jpg)

This is the Monkey's Head Nebula, catalogued as NGC-2175. I honestly didn't know what to expect when I was photographing this. It was just another target that I was trying out, and it is actually pretty cool. The shape of the monkey's head didn't come out until I finalized the processing and it sort of took me by surprise. It turned out really cool, I like how I didn't tone back the busy stars in this one, it creates a deep-space feeling in the photograph.
