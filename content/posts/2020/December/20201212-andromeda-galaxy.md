This is my 2020 collection of Andromeda photos. In 2020 I was experimenting with new gear setups and found a good rhythm for my imaging workflow using M31.  Its very easy to target from my backyard in the Fall, the time its available in the sky gave me plenty of time to correct mistakes!

For this picture I was trying out some new gear, mainly the mount, and trying out some processing in PixInsight for the first time. I used Andromeda because it was an easy target to find, and I had some concept of how to find it using KStars. I was pretty amazed that I was able to get this kind of photo on one of my first attempts with the equatorial mount after completing the hardware setup. I used a Williams Optics ZenithStar 61 telescope and a small ASI120MM Mini mono guide camera with a small 120mm cheap ZWO guide scope. The guiding worked pretty well and I was pleased with the results. I still am pretty new to PixInsight so processing the image took some time and I probably could have done better.

This is a reprocess of Andromeda from the data collected on 11/2/2020. I tried making the core look more smooth and bring out the shape of the center more clearly.

I had not photographed Andromeda in a while, so I decided to reprocess some old data. I wanted to go back to basics and see if I can just do a better job with older data with what I've learned in PixInsight. I feel like I did better in terms of not over-cooking the image, and bringing out the dust-lanes and faint blueish clouds around the outsides of the galaxy.

This was a test of KStars use with my DSLR Nikon D850. I got pretty good data this time and the skies were reasonably clear. I wanted to make a starless image of Andromeda, or just the galaxy itself with nothing around it. I was able to use a star filter in PixInsight to remove the stars from the image. There are better tools than just using a star filter to select, which is part of what I was learning about in PixInsight when processing this image.
