## Why?!

**You ask:**&ensp;*Why did you build this thing and not just buy one?*

As it turns out, most (if not all) of the equipment I use runs on a 12v power supply of some kind, so I figured, I just need a power source that will deliver plenty of amps to drive the telescope and a computer all night. Now the computer is the only piece of gear that uses a different power supply at 19v output, so I had to find a 12v to 19v adapter, cut the plug, and added my own plug that would plug in to the battery box rather than a cigarette-lighter style 12v adapter.

**Here it is:**

## Materials

The box is a NOCO Marine battery box and the battery is a 200Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery. The box cost about $60 and the battery was expensive at around $700, but you could use a cheaper battery like an AGM and it will just be heavier. The battery box has a 10A fuse for the plugs and USB and a 60A fuse for the bare terminals and 2 circuit breakers in weatherproof enclosures. There are a total of 6 USB power ports, 4 Anderson-PowerPole connectors, a battery monitor with digital voltage and amp draw read-out, an On/Off switch to turn off power to the 10A circuit, and a standard cigarette-lighter plug.

## Wiring

Now when we power the telescope rig, most of the components that need power, such as the focuser, camera, controller, etc. already come equipped with a 12v DC power input. I just make cords with Anderson PowerPole on one end, and the normal 5mm DC 12V plug on the other.

## Intel NUC & 19v Adapter

The only thing I run that needs something different is the Intel NUC which I have rigged up a 12V to 19V adapter with an Anderson PowerPole plug that can plug into the battery box.
This battery box will run the computer, monitor, telescope mount, focuser, camera, filter wheel, and whatever else I plug into it for at least 2-3 full-blown nights of imaging but 

## Runtime

I've not tested actual runtime of the battery, since I often fall asleep while the rig is imaging. When I wake up in the morning its still going strong.
