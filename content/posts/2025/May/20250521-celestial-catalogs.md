Galaxies can have both NGC and M designations, reflecting distinct cataloging systems with different purposes.

## A note about well-known celestial catalogs

When viewing my photos and articles, you'll probably wonder why some things are named "NGC" and others are named starting with the letter "M". The main distinction between "NGC" and "M" designations is their origin and numbering method.

## NGC Designation (New General catalog)

The NGC or "New General catalog", created by John Louis Emil Dreyer, employs a numerical system with "NGC" followed by an order-of-right-ascension-based label for various astronomical objects, including galaxies.

## M Designation (Messier Objects)

The M (Messier) catalog, established by Charles Messier, was primarily intended to list objects that might be confused with comets. It assigns numerical labels preceded by "M," based on the order of discovery rather than celestial positions.
