![w-full M45: Pleiades Star Cluster](/catalogue/20201222-Messier45-Pleiades.jpg)

The Pleiades Star Cluster. One of the most noticeable clusters to the naked eye. For most of the summer in the Northern Hemisphere you'll see it travel across the sky in one way or another and wonder what you're looking at. It seems small to the naked eye but its a cluster of 7 bright stars held together tightly by their own gravitation pull. They heat the gases around them and glow blue as the gravity from each star pulls the dust clouds away from each other.
