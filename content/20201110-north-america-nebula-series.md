The North America Nebula, also known as NGC 7000 or , is an emission nebula located in the constellation Cygnus. Spanning approximately 100 light-years, it is one of the largest and most remarkable nebulae in the night sky. This celestial marvel gets its name from its distinct shape, which bears a striking resemblance to the continent of North America. The nebula is situated about 1,600 light-years away from Earth and can be observed with the naked eye under dark skies.

I wound up processing this image twice to get control of a tool in PixInsight that helps remove the background grays and colors from the black space. The second process yeilded better results.
