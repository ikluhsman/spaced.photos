## Astrophotography & Me
I got into Astrophotography in 2020, and since have found it to be a wonderful hobby. I have always had a curiosity for studying outer space.

The skies aren't great here in the city, but within a couple hours drive we have some awesome dark sites and places to go in the mountains that are great for using telescopes.

I was AMAZED with the pictures I was producing with budget equipment and a little bit of online learning.

## The Process

Photographing deep space objects involves capturing images of celestial targets such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters.

The process for capturing a deep space image is quite involved. It takes a lot of curiosity & determination to get the telescope and imaging equipment to take a good picture of what you like to see in space.

You'll need to study these basic components in order to take a good deep-space photograph~

* Specialized observation and imaging equipment
* Location and weather/light conditions
* Polar alignment of your telescope
* Achieving sharp focus on your target and stars
* Framing and composition
* Image acquisition~ exposures, light frames, calibration frames
* Auto-guiding your camera using a computer
* Post-processing your image for a final result

## How I got into Astrophotography

My dad bought me my first Nikon DSLR digital camera back in 2017 for a kayking trip down the Grand Canyon. When I got back, he and I started trying to figure out how to take pictures of the night sky.

As soon as I was able to produce some star trails, it became apparent during long exposures that we needed a star tracker! I was SO excited to be able to keep the camera still while it exposed the Milky Way.

After discovering German Equatorial Telescope Mounts, we broke down and bought a telescope and a computerized mount.

Since then, I've created a great setup for my back yard that produces some very impressive pictures. I have also developed a portable setup to carry with me camping, hiking, or otherwise.  
  
## Money

My gosh, this hobby is expensive. Forget buying a new car.

It wasn't until I started working with telescopes that I actually started figuring out some of the science around the physics of outer space. First I was getting into DSLR photography and bought a very nice and expensive camera. I started taking a few night pictures, then my dad and I got fascinated with taking pictures of the stars.

As I was reading up on that, I started understanding exposure time in taking night photos, which I think is the specific thing that was so fascinating and intriguing about night sky photography.

So I quickly learned I needed something to hold the camera still while moving it with the Earth's rotation, in order to capture a picture with a long enough exposure time to gather colors from space.

I started spending a bit on more equipment as I learned what I needed. I wound up with an Explore Scientific EXOS2 PMC-8 equatorial mount, and went at it - armed with youtube videos and some forums I googled for online. I will mention that Trevor from [Astrobackyard](https://astrobackyard.com) was a pretty big help and in the end I realized he helped me most with his hardware reviews so I'd know what good budget pieces of gear to focus in on.

## Equipment I Use

So in the end I wound up with three telescopes, and a reasonably sturdy mount that I think is great for a beginner. The telescope I use the most right now taking pictures of Nebulae and Galaxies is the Explore Scientific ED102-FCD100 which is a Triplet Air-Spaced Refractor. Now my target selection is probably somewhat limited in terms of focal length, or being able to capture a relatively small object up close.

I don't have a large SCT, but I'm in the market for one. With the refractors, I have taken fantastic shots of large bright nebulas, larger galaxies, and a few star clusters. I haven't sunk into planetary photography, mostly because with the equipment I have I can't really get close-up enough to anything except the moon for it to be worth the time and effort for me. I'd rather spend the time on other shots until I ramp up for some different equipment and study a bit more to get a closer look at planets.
