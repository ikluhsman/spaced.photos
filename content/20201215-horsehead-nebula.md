I shot both of them since my telescopes have a relatively large field of view and I hadn't quite yet understood the concept of "framing" the image. I thought the image data was good, but my processing skills could use a level up at this point. I started looking into [PixInsight tutorials](https://pixinsight.com/tutorials/) on their website, and all of a sudden the world completely changed.

So I re-processed it again the next day. Here's the result of that.

## 12.9.2020

After a little more practice with PixInsight, I had a clearer night on 12/9/2020. Here is another complete re-take of the imagery, then using the new skills I had acquired. My dad uses this picture for his background images on his Windows computers.
