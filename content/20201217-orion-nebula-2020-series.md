In November 2020 I started photographing the Orion Nebula. Its a fairly easy target to begin to learn to gather enough light using long exposures since it is a very bright and large object.

This was my first use of the Optolong L-Extreme narrow-band Filter. I had just picked it up and was so anxious to try it and see the results that I minimized exposure time just so I could get to processing faster. It also proved that you don't need a lot of exposure time to get an acceptable picture. Something happened in this integration where the nebula wound up a little blurry, but I thought it was so cool how the narrow-band filter rigidly cut all other colors except the oxygen and hydrogen spectrum. Some say photographing M42 and M43 in narrow-band destroys the natural look of Orion's nebula, but this was just a test really. The L-Extreme performed well and I began to see what it was really needed for. It was then I had my sights set on the L-Enhance filter as well, so I'm not eliminating spectrums that I'd like to have in the picture with the L-Enhance, but it will help a ton with the light pollution around my Bortle 8 area.

Orion Remix - I re-did the integration from 10/28/2020 of the Orion Nebula because I think I found this is when I was able to start taking good calibration frames that made a noticeable difference in processing.

This is certainly the best shot I have taken of M42. It was taken with a L-Extreme narrowband filter. You can see the Oxygen and Hydrogen emissions from the nebula in the blue and red colors, and the other colors are muted by the filter. I love Mairan's nebula at the top it looks like glowing red bull horns.
