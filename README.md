# spaced.photos
A website built in Nuxt.js to showcase my Astrophotography work.

/articles -

Published articles where I talk about the objects I've photographed.

/catalogue -

A catalogue of all pictures, with a grouped view by object type (nebulae, starcluster, etc) and sorted by messier or NGC object identifiers. Each pic should have some metadata and a content page.

/gallery -

A nice-looking gallery of my favorite pictures.
